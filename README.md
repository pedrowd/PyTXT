# PyTXT

I want to make a puzzle game based around text. Then I thought it would be a good idea to make it in Python.
I still have many things I want to add, and I accept help from anyone. The following is what I want to include:
 - [x] The player
 - [ ] Walls that stop you
 - [ ] Traps
 - [ ] Portals
 - [ ] Pushable Blocks
 - [ ] Twin Push (a group of pushable blocks that when you push one, the others get pushed the same way)
 - [ ] Move Block (a block that moves when you move)
 - [ ] Merge Push (a block that grows when pushed into another one of its kind)

That is all you need to know.
